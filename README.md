# Order manager web app for CMQUEL
Order manager web app developed for the company CMQUEL. 

It is developed with HTML, CSS and Javascript. For the backend I am using express.js to manage the endpoints and mssql
to connect an Azure SQL databse with the server. For the frontend I am using Javascript vanilla.

In the following images you can see the different pages of the web app.
